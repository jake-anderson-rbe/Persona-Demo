(ignore this, just using this in replit for safe keeping)
def dialogue_test():
    decide = input("a or b? ")
    relationship_level = range(0, 25)
    #add = relationship_level + 1
    if decide == "a":
      print("good choice")
      dialogue_level_up()
      print(test_dude.level)
      relationship_level += 1
    elif decide == "b":
      print("bad choice")
      dialogue_level_down()
      print(test_dude.level)
    elif relationship_level <= 25:
      print("test")
